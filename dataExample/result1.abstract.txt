                <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Malaria cases persist in some remote areas in Sabah and Sarawak despite the ongoing and largely successful malaria control programme conducted by the Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, Ministry Of Health, Malaysia. Point mutations in the genes that encode the two enzymes involved in the folate biosynthesis pathway, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) enzymes confer resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine respectively, in both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. The aim of the current study was to determine the mutation on both pvdhfr at codon 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117, and 173 and pvdhps genes at codon 383 and 553, which are potentially associated with resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine in P. vivax samples in Sabah.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Every individual was screened for presence of malaria infection using a commercial rapid dipstick assay, ParaMax-3&#x2122; (Zephyr Biomedical, India). Individuals tested positive for P. vivax had blood collected and parasite DNA extracted. The pvdhfr and pvdhps genes were amplified by nested-PCR. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was carried out for detection of specific mutations in pvdhfr at codons 13Leu, 33Leu, 57Ile/Leu, 58Arg, 61Met, 117Asn/Thr, and 173Leu and pvdhps at codons 383Gly and 553Gly. The PCR-RFLP products were analysed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technology, AS).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 619 and 2119 individuals from Kalabakan and Kota Marudu, respectively participated in the study. In Kalabakan and Kota Marudu, 9.37 and 2.45&#xA0;% were tested positive for malaria and the positivity for P. vivax infection was 4.2 and 0.52&#xA0;%, respectively. No mutation was observed at codon 13, 33 and 173 on pvdhfr and at codon 553 on pvdhps gene on samples from Kalabakan and Kota Marudu. One-hundred per cent mutations on pvdhfr were at 57Leu and 117Thr. Mutation at 58Arg and 61Met was observed to be higher in Kota Marudu 72.73&#xA0;%. Mutation at 383Gly on pvdhps was highest in Kalabakan with 80.77&#xA0;%. There are four distinct haplotypes of pvdhfr/pvdhps combination.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The presence of triple and quintuple mutation combination suggest that the P. vivax isolates exhibit a high degree of resistant to sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination therapy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>A recent discussion expanded the debate about the experimental research on Gelsemium in anxiety. Herbal medicine is widely used in anxiety and mood disorders, often with contradictory evidence, although some authors are yet prompted to promote their full introduction in pharmacology as a promising therapy. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in anxiety is particularly appreciated by individual healthcare, but deserves further investigation, as many critical issues have been recently raised. Comments about the ability of negligible doses of Gelsemium hydroalcoholic extracts to affect gene expression were recently reported.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited renal disorder caused by mutations of either PKD1 or PKD2 gene. Cyst formation initiates from a combination of abnormal cell proliferation along with enhanced fluid secretion. ADPKD is characterized by the progressive enlargement of cysts which destroy the renal parenchymal cells, resulting in renal failure. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this disease. Interestingly, several relevant therapeutic effects of herbal medicine relevant to pathogenic process of ADPKD have urged the researchers to search for potential candidate herb as nutraceutical for ADPKD therapy. Up to now, several natural compounds, such as triptolide, curcumin, ginkolide B, and steviol (stevia extract) have been shown to be able to retard cyst progression in ADPKD. The detailed mechanism of these compounds showed that triptolide enhanced calcium restoration, curcumin inhibited ERK &amp; p-STAT3 pathways, ginkolide B inhibited Ras/MAPK pathway, and steviol activated AMPK, which inhibited CFTR channel and mTOR pathway in cell and mouse models of PKD. In addition, they are currently inpreclinical and clinical studies, respectively. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of ADPKD and the recent therapeutic approaches, especially a potential use of nutraceutical for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of combined 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25 D) and resveratrol on cardiac arrhythmias, infarct size, and transcription of catalase, thioredoxin-1 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in male rats. Ligation of coronary artery was performed in rats (n = 6 per group) without any treatment (IR group), pretreated with 0.1 &#x3BC;g/kg/day of 1,25 D (1,25 D + IR), 1 mg/kg/day of resveratrol (Res + IR) or a combination (1,25 D + Res + IR) for 14 days. Arrhythmias were analyzed according to the Lambeth conventions, and infarct size was measured by 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride staining. Expression of prosurvival genes was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the 1,25 D + Res + IR group the mean infarct size was 17.6 &#xB1; 3.5 %, which was significantly less than that in the IR, 1,25 D + IR, and Res + IR groups (p &lt; 0.001). Although the single therapy of either 1,25 D or resveratrol did not change the incidence of arrhythmias significantly, a reduction in the number of ventricular ectopic beats was noted in group 1,25 D + Res + IR (179.19 &#xB1; 58.87, p &lt; 0.001 vs IR; p &lt; 0.05 vs Res + IR; p &lt; 0.01 vs Vit D + IR). Combination of 1,25 D and resveratrol increased transcription of catalase by 119 &#xB1; 37 % (p &lt; 0.001 vs IR, p &lt; 0.01 vs Res + IR, p &lt; 0.001 vs 1,25 D + IR). Our study showed that combination of a non-hypotensive dose of 1,25 D and resveratrol can be a novel and effective strategy for protecting against ischemia.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant global public health risk. In tropical countries such as India where periodic dengue outbreaks can be correlated to the high prevalence of the mosquito vector, circulation of all four dengue viruses (DENVs) and the high population density, a drug for dengue is being increasingly recognized as an unmet public health need.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Using the knowledge of traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, we developed a systematic bioassay-guided screening approach to explore the indigenous herbal bio-resource to identify plants with pan-DENV inhibitory activity. Our results show that the alcoholic extract of Cissampelos pariera Linn (Cipa extract) was a potent inhibitor of all four DENVs in cell-based assays, assessed in terms of viral NS1 antigen secretion using ELISA, as well as viral replication, based on plaque assays. Virus yield reduction assays showed that Cipa extract could decrease viral titers by an order of magnitude. The extract conferred statistically significant protection against DENV infection using the AG129 mouse model. A preliminary evaluation of the clinical relevance of Cipa extract showed that it had no adverse effects on platelet counts and RBC viability. In addition to inherent antipyretic activity in Wistar rats, it possessed the ability to down-regulate the production of TNF-&#x3B1;, a cytokine implicated in severe dengue disease. Importantly, it showed no evidence of toxicity in Wistar rats, when administered at doses as high as 2g/Kg body weight for up to 1 week.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our findings above, taken in the context of the human safety of Cipa, based on its use in Indian traditional medicine, warrant further work to explore Cipa as a source for the development of an inexpensive herbal formulation for dengue therapy. This may be of practical relevance to a dengue-endemic resource-poor country such as India.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Cinnamomum verum has been used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. We evaluated the anticancer effect of 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (2-MCA), a constituent of the bark of the plant, in hepatocellular carcinoma Hep 3B cells. The results show that 2-MCA suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis as indicated by an up-regulation of pro-apoptotic bax and bak genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and bcl-XL genes, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase 3 and 9, increase in the DNA content in sub G1, and morphological characteristics of apoptosis. 2-MCA also induced lysosomal vacuolation with increased volume of acidic compartments (VAC), suppressions of nuclear transcription factors NF-&#x3BA;B, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and both topoisomerase I and II activities in a dose-dependent manner. Further study reveals the growth-inhibitory effect of 2-MCA was also evident in a nude mice model. Taken together, the data suggest that the growth-inhibitory effect of 2-MCA against Hep 3B cells is accompanied by downregulations of NF-&#x3BA;B binding activity, inflammatory responses involving COX-2 and PGE2, and proliferative control involving apoptosis, both topoisomerase I and II activities, together with an upregulation of lysosomal vacuolation and VAC. Our data suggest that 2-MCA could be a potential agent for anticancer therapy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>To make clear of the absorbed components of Tianzhusan (TZS) and its possible mechanism in preventing vascular dementia (VD), the rats' models of VD were prepared by a permanent ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries. After 60 days, rats were administrated with TZS for 0.1 g x kg(-1), and the volume is 0.02 mL x g(-1). After 3 days, the medicated serum was prepared and detected by UPLC, and then we predicted the possible chemical structure of the absorbed components of TZS. According to the absorbed components, the potential targets of TZS were found by ligand profiling of Discovery Studio 3.5. All of these target genes were submitted to DAVID onine for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The 5 absorbed components of TZS have been predicted, and four of them have been identified as parishin B, parishin C, parishin, pennogenin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosy-(1--&gt;2)-beta-D-glucoside. Through reverse finding targets, we got 861 pharmacophore models and 9 pathways from KEGG, BIOCARTA after document verification. These results showed that the efficacy mechanism of TZS on VD perhaps were be related with these absorbed components and pathways. If the traditional herbs could be proved effective by efficacy tests, the serum pharmacochemistry, computer-aided drug design, system biology and other technologies can be used in the next experiments, which will be beneficial to fast discovery of material basis and mechanisms of traditional medicine coming form ethnic minorities.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>To investigate the urination-reducing effect and mechanism of Zhuangyao Jianshen Wan (ZYJCW). In this study, SI rats were subcutaneously injected with 150 mg &#xB7; kg(-1) dose of D-galactose to prepare the sub-acute aging model and randomly divided into the model group, the Suoquan Wan group (1.17 g &#xB7; kg(-1) &#xB7; d(-1)), and ZYJCW high, medium and low dose groups (2.39, 1.20, 0.60 g &#xB7; kg(-1) &#xB7; d(-1)) , with normal rats in the blank group. They were continuously administered with drugs for eight weeks. The metabolic cage method was adopted to measure the 24 h urine volume and 5 h water load urine volume in rats. The automatic biochemistry analyzer was adopted to detect urine concentrations of Na+, Cl-, K+. The ELISA method was used to determine serum aldosterone (ALD) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The changes in P2X1 and P2X3 mRNA expressions in bladder tissues of rats were detected by RT-PCR. According to the results, both ZYJCW high and medium dose groups showed significant down-regulations in 24 h urine volume and 5 h water load urine volume in (P &lt;0.05, P &lt;0.01), declines in Na+ and Cl- concentrations in urine (P &lt;0.01), notable rises in plasma ALD and ADH contents (P &lt;0.05, P &lt;0.01) and remarkable down-regulations in the P2X1 and P2X3 mRNA expressions in bladder tissues (P &lt;0.01). The ZYJCW low dose group revealed obvious reductions in Na+ and Cl- concentrations in urine (P &lt;0.01). The results indicated that ZYJCW may show the urination-reducing effect by down-regulating the P2X1 and P2X3 mRNA expressions in bladder tissues of rats with diuresis caused by kidney deficiency.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>To investigate the effect of Butylphthalide and Xue Shuan Tong on serum inflammatory factors and prognosis of patients with cerebral infarction. One hundred and twenty patients with acute cerebral infarction were randomly divided into control group, Butylphthalide group and Xue Shuan Tong group, with 40 patients in each group. Conventional therapy was performed in the control group; On the basis of conventional therapy, 100ml Butylphthalide intravenously twice a day was administrated among patients in Butylphthalide group; On the basis of conventional therapy, 250ml 0.9% NaCl intravenously once a day was conducted among patients in Xue Shuan Tong group. A treatment course of continuous 7 days was taken in the three groups. The serum levels of IL-2 and CGRP were detected for patients in the three groups before and after treatment. Carotid plaque thickness and size as well as intima-media thickness were detected by ultrasonic testing for patients in three groups before treatment and 90 days after follow-up. The NIHSS, Barthel and MRS scoring were performed for all the patients after 90-day follow-up to evaluate the prognosis. After treatment, differences in the levels of IL-2 and CGRP for patients in the three groups showed statistical significance (P&lt;0.05), while the levels of IL-2 and CGRP in Xue Shuan Tong group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P&lt;0.05). After 7-day treatment, plaque size and thickness in Xue Shuan Tong group and Butylphthalide group were significantly reduced, compared with those before treatment (P&lt;0.05), but no significant differences was shown in the plaque size and thickness between Xue Shuan Tong group and Butylphthalide group (P&gt;0.05) .The CA-IMT in Xue Shuan Tong group and Butylphthalide group was significantly reduced after treatment, and that in Butylphthalide group was significantly larger than that in Xue Shuan Tong group (P&lt;0.05). After 90-day follow-up, NIHSS scores in Butylphthalide group were significantly less than those in the other two groups (P&lt;0.05). After 90-day follow-up, Barthel scores in Butylphthalide group and Xue Shuan Tong group were significantly larger than those in control group (P&lt;0.05), while differences between Butylphthalide group and Xue Shuan Tong group indicated no statistical significance (P&gt;0.05). There were significant differences in MRS scores among patients in the three groups after 90-day follow-up (P&lt;0.05). Butylphthalide and Xue Shuan Tong are clinically effective in treating acute cerebral infarction. Butylphthalide has significant efficacy in inhibiting inflammation and improving prognosis of neurological function, while Xue Shuan Tong has obvious effect in improving carotid intima-media thickness.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Chronic fibrosis is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pathological progression of hepatic fibrosis has been linked to cellular processes that promote tumor growth and metastasis. Several recent studies have highlighted the cross-talk between tumor cells and activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) in HCC. The herbal compound Songyou Yin (SYY) is known to attenuate hepatoma cell invasion and metastasis via down-regulation of cytokine secretion by aHSCs. However the underlying mechanism of SYY treatment in reversal of hepatic fibrosis and metastasis of liver cancers is not known. In the current study, a nude mouse model with liver fibrosis bearing orthotopic xenograft was established and we found that SYY could reduce associated fibrosis, inhibit tumor growth and improve survival. In the subcutaneous tumor model with fibrosis, we found that SYY could inhibit liver cancer. In vitro, hepatoma cells incubated with conditioned media (CM) from SYY treated aHSCs showed reduced proliferation, decrease in colony formation and invasive potential. SYY treated group showed altered gene expression, with 1205 genes up-regulated and 1323 genes down-regulated. Gene cluster analysis indicated that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) was one of the key genes altered in the expression profiles. PI3K related markers were all significantly down-regulated. ELISA also indicated decreased secretion of cytokines which were regulated by PI3K/AKT signaling after SYY treatment in the hepatic stellate cell line, LX2. These data clearly demonstrate that SYY therapy inhibits HCC invasive and metastatic potential and improves survival in nude mice models with chronic fibrosis background via inhibition of cytokine secretion by activated hepatic stellate cells.</AbstractText>

AFE&#x2009;+&#x2009;VME was orally administrated to mice with the HFD at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks. We observed the effects of mixed extract on body weight, fat mass, serum lipid levels, and mRNA expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in the adipose tissue of mice.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The nutritional analysis revealed that this mixed extract is high in carbohydrate (72.2 g/100 g) and protein (11.5 g/100 g); low in fat (1.7 g/100 g); rich in vitamins E (4.8 mg/100 g), B1 (14.8 mg/100 g), B2 (1.0 mg/100 g), niacin (7.9 mg/100 g), and folic acid (1.57 mg/100 g); and rich in minerals such as calcium (600 mg/100 g), iron (106.1 mg/100 g), and zinc (5.8 mg/100 g). The oral administration of AFE&#x2009;+&#x2009;VME in obese mice reduced body weight, tissue weight, adipocyte size, and lipid accumulation in the liver compared with HFD control mice. AFE&#x2009;+&#x2009;VME also decreased serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and leptin concentrations. Furthermore, AFE&#x2009;+&#x2009;VME markedly increased the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x3B3; (PPAR-&#x3B3;), uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), and adiponectin and decreased leptin expression in the epididymal white adipose tissue.

                <AbstractText>To observe the protective effect and mechanism of Sailuotong capsule in focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion model was established. The expressions of dynamin-related protein 1 ( Drp1) and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) were tested by Western blot. The transmission electron microscope was used to observe the changes in the mitochondrial ultra-structure. The pathological morphological changes were observed through the HE staining. The immunohistochemical method was used to test Drp1 and Opa1 expressions. Sailuotong capsule (33, 16.5 mg x kg(-1), ig) can inhibit the abnormal mitochondrial fission and fusion in the cortical area on the ischemia side and the mitochondrial fission gene expression and promote the mitochondrial fusion gene Opa1 expression, so as to alleviate the energy metabolism disorder caused by ischemia/reperfusion. Sailuotong capsule can inhibit the abnormal mitochondrial dynamics in peri-ischemic regions and maintain the normal morphology of mitochondria, which may be the mechanism of Sailuotong capsule in promoting the self-recovery function in the ischemic brain region.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>MicroRNA (miRNA) has become the spotlight of the biomedical research around the world and is considered to be a major post-transcriptional gene regulator. This small, endogenous RNA (21-25 nucleotides long) plays an important role by targeting specific mRNAs in plants, animals and humans. Herbal medicine has been used for thousands of years, however little is known about its molecular mechanism of action. Since the discovery of plant miRNA in human tissue and sera after ingestion, the connection between the two kingdoms is presented under a new perspective. Forward pharmacology, such as miRNA therapeutics could be the next best step toward identifying novel therapeutic options involving medicinal plants. Besides reporting the latest findings regarding the cross-kingdom transfer of miRNA and its therapeutic application, this review can inform further investigations that could lead to a modern definition of herbal medicine.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Traditional Chinese medicine Curcuma Zedoary ( E'Zhu) contains essential oil, curcuminoid and other effective constituents, with such pharmacological actions as anti-platelet aggregation, lowing blood lipid, anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation. In recent years, studies have showed that certain extracts and chemical components of E'Zhu could mitigate myocardial cell mitochondria injury and protect vascular endothelium by enhancing heme oxygenase-1 activity, inhibit nuclear factor NF-kappaB, target genes interleukin-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-6 (TRAF-6) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), reduce inflammatory infiltration, and inhibit growth factor-induced smooth muscle cells (SMCs) proliferation and migration by impacting oxidation of cellular phosphatases. Due to its different functions in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, E'Zhu has been applied in drug-eluting stents, with a potential effect in preventing in-stent restenosis and thrombogenesis. In this paper, studies on pharmacological effects and mechanisms of extracts and main chemical constituents from E'Zhu in preventing vascular restenosis were summarized.</AbstractText>

Samul-tang (SMT) is a widely used traditional herbal medicine in East Asia and is also known as Shimotsu-to in Japanese and Si-Wu decoction in Chinese. This study was designed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of SMT on retinal pathogenic angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHOD" NlmCategory="METHODS">The mice were exposed to a 75% concentration of oxygen for five days, starting on postnatal day 7 (P7-P12). The mice were then exposed to room air and were intraperitoneally injected with SMT (10 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) once per day for five days (P12-P16). On P17, we measured retinal neovascularization and evaluated both the expression of angiogenesis-related proteins and changes in the gene expression level in the mRNA.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">SMT reduced the area of the central retina and reduced retinal neovascularization in OIR mice. The protein array revealed that SMT reduced the level of SDF-1 protein expression. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the HIF-1&#x3B1;, SDF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF mRNA levels in the retinas of OIR mice were elevated compared with those of normal control mice. However, SMT decreased the levels of HIF-1&#x3B1;, SDF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF mRNA in OIR mice.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Cancer cells have both tumor-adaptive and -suppressive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress machineries that determine cell fate. In malignant tumors including lymphoma, constant activation of tumor-adaptive ER stress and concurrent reduction of tumor-suppressive ER stress favors cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Current ER stress-based anti-tumor drugs typically activate both tumor-adaptive and -suppressive ER stresses, resulting in low anti-cancer efficacy; hence, selective induction of tumor-suppressive ER stress and inhibition of tumor-adaptive ER stress are new strategies for novel anti-cancer drug discovery. Thus far, specific tumor-suppressive ER stress therapeutics have remained absent in clinical settings. In this study, we explored unique tumor-suppressive ER stress agents from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Oroxylum indicum, and found that a small molecule oroxin B selectively induced tumor-suppressive ER stress in malignant lymphoma cells, but not in normal cells, effectively inhibited lymphoma growth in vivo, and significantly prolonged overall survival of lymphoma-xenografted mice without obvious toxicity. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the expression of key tumor-adaptive ER-stress gene GRP78 was notably suppressed by oroxin B via down-regulation of up-stream key signaling protein ATF6, while tumor-suppressive ER stress master gene DDIT3 was strikingly activated through activating the MKK3-p38 signaling pathway, correcting the imbalance between tumor-suppressive DDIT3 and tumor-adaptive GRP78 in lymphoma. Together, selective induction of unique tumor-suppressive ER stress and concurrent inhibition of tumor-adaptive ER stress in malignant lymphoma are new and feasible approaches for novel anti-lymphoma drug discovery and anti-lymphoma therapy.</AbstractText>

All CHR were superior to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment in successfully ameliorating brain function, infarction, and neurological deficits in stroke mice that also paralleled to improvements in blood-brain barrier damage, inflammation, apoptosis, and neurogenesis. Transcriptome analyses reveals that a total of 774 ischemia-induced probe sets were significantly modulated by four CHR, including 52 commonly upregulated genes and 54 commonly downregulated ones. Among them, activation of neurogenesis-associated signaling pathways and down-regulating inflammation and apoptosis pathways are key common mechanisms in ischemic stroke protection by all CHR. Besides, levels of plasma CX3CL1 and S100a9 in patients could be used as biomarkers for therapeutic evaluation before functional recovery could be observed.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our results suggest that using CHR, a combinatory cocktail therapy, is a better way than rt-PA for treating cerebral ischemic-associated diseases through modulating a common as well as a specific group of genes/pathways that may partially explain the syndrome differentiation and treatment principle in TCM.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Collagenase VII was injected into the caudate nucleus of Sprague-Dawley rats to induce ICH. Chinese herbs (musk, borneol and tetrandrine) were intragastrically administered, and acupuncture was performed using Dazhui, Fengfu and Shuigou acupoints. Each group was further subdivided into 4 subgroups based on treatment duration (6-hour, 24-hour, 72-hour, and 1-week). Neurological impairment score, TUNEL assay and apoptotic markers, BCL-2, BAX, and caspase-3 were used to evaluate the apoptosis status after ICH and subsequent treatment.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Chinese herbal therapy and acupuncture improved neurological impairment compared with no therapy and sham-operated animals. Significant differences in TUNEL positive cells were found between treatment groups (p &lt; 0.001) and over time (p &lt; 0.001). Differential expression of BCL-2, BAX, and caspase-3 was observed between treatment groups (p = 0.014 for BAX and &lt; 0.05 for BCL-2 and caspase-3) and treatment duration groups (p = 0.006 for BAX and &lt; 0.05 BCL-2 and caspase-3).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Results indicate that Chinese herbs and acupuncture may improve neural impairment and reduce apoptosis, although there was no difference between therapies in a rat model of ICH. Additional experiments are needed to further clarify the role of these therapies following ICH.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="METHOD" NlmCategory="METHODS">The MTT test was adopted to observe the effect of different concentrations of naringenin on the growth capacity of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. Wound healing and transwell experiment analysis were conducted to detect the effect of naringenin on the migration of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. Western blotting was adopted to investigate the effect of naringenin on protein expressions of MDA-MB-231 cell Integrin &#x3B2;3, &#x3B2;1 and matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and MMP-9. The computer virtual docking technique was used to evaluate the combining capacity of naringenin and Integrin &#x3B2;3 in vitro.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULT" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Naringenin inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

                <AbstractText>The medicinal properties of the most successful plant in the deserts of the western hemisphere, the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), are evidenced by the long traditional usage of the plants by the Native Americans Indian tribes in Southwestern North America and the Amerindians from South America. The plant is rich in simple bisphenyl lignans and tricyclic lignans known as cyclolignans. These compounds are responsible for many of the pharmacological activities of extracts of the plants. Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging. Molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anticancer activities have been elucidated and involve the inhibition of SP1 dependent gene transcription. This review summarizes the recent findings on creosote bush lignans. We introduce the concept of a cocktail of safe well-characterized natural products from the creosote bush that would represent a bridge between oriental herbal medicines and Western drug-based therapies.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Development of the disease is the result of several factors involved in biological network changes. The nature of drug intervention is to regulate these pathological changes to the normal range. Advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are to integrally and systematically regulate this biological networks and systematic pathology through multi-targets, multi-levels, multi-channels. Structural components TCM provides the controlled and precise basis "substance" for this regulation and also to clarify the "truth" of the nature of the regulation by the network pharmacology. Network pharmacology provides new strategy for the research on mechanism of structural components TCM. This study not only reflects the overall characteristics of the development of the disease, but also fully embodies the essence of TCM for preventing and treating diseases through changing traditional model on "one drug, one gene, one disease". This paper explores systematically the integration essence, features and research strategies of structural components TCM and the network pharmacology, understand the interaction of structural components TCM and body from the perspective of the overall concept of improving or restoring the balance of.biological networks. It is effective measure to reveal the structure of a multi-component for regulating biological networks mechanisms, and also provide new ideas and methods for further scientific research and innovation of structural component TCM.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Current management of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) includes an attempt at slowing down the degenerative process through therapies that use either Western or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Novel therapies in Western medicine (WM) include use of tailor-made gene therapy, transplantation of stem cells, or neuroprotection treatment. TCM treatment includes two major approaches. These are orally applied herbal decoctions and acupuncture. In fact, all TCM treatments are based on the differentiation of a symptom-complex, which is the characteristic essence of TCM. Thus, diagnosed RP may be treated via the liver, the kidney, and the spleen. The principle behind these treatments is to invigorate the blood and brighten the eyes by toning up the liver and the kidney. Also treatments to cope with deficiencies in the two concepts that are unique and fundamental to TCM are considered: Qi or "vital energy" and Yin and Yang or the harmony of all the opposite elements and forces that make up existence. In particular, the Qi deficiency that results from blood stasis is addressed in these treatments. This paper also puts forward the existing problems and the prospect of the future development on integrating TCM with WM.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Cystinuria is an autosomal inherited disorder of renal reabsorption of cystine, arginine, lysine, and ornithine. Increased urinary excretion of cystine results in the formation of kidney stones. Considering the few studies on the genetic basis of the cystinuria in the Middle East and the population-specific distribution of mutations in the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes, in the present study, mutation analysis of these two genes was performed in a cohort of Iranian patients with cystinuria. Thirty unrelated cystinuria patients were analyzed for four of the most common mutations using ARMS-PCR (M467T, T216M) and RFLP-PCR (G105R, R333W) methods. For negative sample, two exons of both genes, which harbor many mutations, were subject to DNA sequencing. Eight variants were identified including missense, polymorphism, intron variant, and a novel variant. The most frequent mutations were not detected in our patients and only G105R was found. Since the molecular genetic testing results may influence the therapy and prognosis of cystinuria, this paper contributes to understanding of the molecular basis of cystinuria in the Iranian patients.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Inflammatory mediators are key players in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and bone destruction. Conventional drugs suppress symptomatic activity and have no therapeutic influence on disease. Cissus quadrangularis and Withania somnifera are widely used for the treatment of bone fractures and wounds; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulated by these herbals are still unclear.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We established an in vitro OA culture model by exposing human chondrocytes to proinflammatory cytokine and interleukin (IL)-1&#x3B2; for 36 hours prior to treatment with the herbals: C. quadrangularis, W. somnifera, and the combination of the two herbals. Cell viability, toxicity, and gene expression of OA modifying agents were examined. In addition, expression of survivin, which is crucial for cell growth, was analyzed. In vivo work on osteotomized rats studied the bone and cartilage regenerative effects of C. quadrangularis, W. somnifera, and the combination therapy.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Exposure of chondrocytes to IL-1&#x3B2; induced significant toxicity and cell death. However, herbal treatment alleviated IL-1&#x3B2; induced cell toxicity and upregulated cell growth and proliferation. C. quadrangularis inhibited gene expression of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, known to aggravate cartilage and bone destruction, and augmented expression of survivin by inhibiting p38 MAPK. Interestingly, osteotomized rats treated with C. quadrangularis drastically enhanced alkaline phosphatase and cartilage tissue formation as compared to untreated, W. somnifera only, or the combination of both herbals.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our findings demonstrate for the first time the signaling mechanisms regulated by C. quadrangularis and W. somnifera in OA and osteogenesis. We suggest that the chondroprotective effects and regenerative ability of these herbals are via the upregulation of survivin that exerts inhibitory effects on the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. These findings thus validate C. quadrangularis as a potential therapeutic for rheumatic disorders.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Male rats were treated with liquid fructose in their drinking water over 14 weeks. Jiangzhi Capsule was co-administered (once daily, by oral gavage) during the last 7 weeks. Indexes of lipid and glucose homeostasis were determined enzymatically, by ELISA and/or histologically. Gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Treatment with Jiangzhi Capsule (100 mg/kg) attenuated fructose-induced excessive triglyceride accumulation and Oil Red O-stained area in the liver. This effect was accompanied by amelioration of hyperinsulinemia. There was no significant difference in intakes of fructose and chow, and body weight between fructose control and fructose Jiangzhi Capsule-treated groups. Mechanistically, Jiangzhi Capsule downregulated fructose-stimulated hepatic overexpression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1/1c at the mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, the SREBP-1c downstream genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, were also inhibited. In addition, acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in the liver was also inhibited after Jiangzhi Capsule treatment. In contrast, Jiangzhi Capsule affected neither carbohydrate response element binding protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma and DGAT-1, nor PPAR-alpha and its target genes.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Accumulated data has shown that various vasculogenic tumor cells, including gastric cancer cells, are able to directly form tumor blood vessels via vasculogenic mimicry, supplying oxygen and nutrients to tumors, and facilitating progression and metastasis of malignant tumors. Therefore, tumor vasculogenic mimicry is a rational target for developing novel anticancer therapeutics. However, effective antitumor vasculogenic mimicry-targeting drugs are not clinically available. In this study, we purified 2,7-dihydroxyl-1-methyl-5-vinyl-phenanthrene, termed dehydroeffusol, from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Juncus effusus L., and found that dehydroeffusol effectively inhibited gastric cancer cell-mediated vasculogenic mimicry in vitro and in vivo with very low toxicity. Dehydroeffusol significantly suppressed gastric cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Molecular mechanistic studies revealed that dehydroeffusol markedly inhibited the expression of a vasculogenic mimicry master gene VE-cadherin and reduced adherent protein exposure on the cell surface by inhibiting gene promoter activity. In addition, dehydroeffusol significantly decreased the expression of a key vasculogenic gene matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in gastric cancer cells, and diminished MMP2 protease activity. Together, our results showed that dehydroeffusol effectively inhibited gastric cancer cell-mediated vasculogenic mimicry with very low toxicity, suggesting that dehydroeffusol is a potential drug candidate for anti-gastric cancer neovascularization and anti-gastric cancer therapy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>There is a wide range of drugs and combinations under investigation and/or approved over the last decade to treat colorectal cancer (CRC), but the 5-year survival rate remains poor at stages II-IV. Therefore, new, more-efficient drugs still need to be developed that will hopefully be included in first-line therapy or overcome resistance when it appears, as part of second- or third-line treatments in the near future. In this study, we revealed that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors have high therapeutic potential in CRC according to combinative analysis of NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository and chemical genomic database of Connectivity Map (CMap). We found that second generation Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922, significantly downregulated the activities of a broad spectrum of kinases involved in regulating cell growth arrest and death of NVP-AUY922-sensitive CRC cells. To overcome NVP-AUY922-induced upregulation of survivin expression which causes drug insensitivity, we found that combining berberine (BBR), a herbal medicine with potency in inhibiting survivin expression, with NVP-AUY922 resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects for NVP-AUY922-sensitive and -insensitive CRC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment of NVP-AUY922-insensitive CRC cells with the combination of NVP-AUY922 and BBR caused cell growth arrest through inhibiting CDK4 expression and induction of microRNA-296-5p (miR-296-5p)-mediated suppression of Pin1-&#x3B2;-catenin-cyclin D1 signaling pathway. Finally, we found that the expression level of Hsp90 in tumor tissues of CRC was positively correlated with CDK4 and Pin1 expression levels. Taken together, these results indicate that combination of NVP-AUY922 and BBR therapy can inhibit multiple oncogenic signaling pathways of CRC.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The roots of Ostericum koreanum (OK) Maximowicz have traditionally been used to produce an herbal medicine reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, and antitumor activities; however, its effect on bone metabolism has not yet been reported. The present study examined the effects of OK extract on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone loss in mice by investigating bone structure and the levels of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in serum and bone marrow fluid (BMF). The effects of OK extract on osteoclastogenesis were also investigated in mouse bone marrow macrophages by examining the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells, the actin ring, and bone resorption activity. OK reduced LPS-induced bone destruction in vivo via a decrease in the RANKL/OPG ratio. Furthermore, it suppressed the formation of TRAP-positive cells and the actin ring, and reduced the bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts. OK also significantly down-regulated the expression of various osteoclast-specific genes. However, it did not affect osteoblast differentiation, or the expression of genes involved in this process. These results demonstrated that OK prevented LPS-induced bone loss by decreasing the RANKL/OPG ratio in serum and BMF, and inhibited osteoclast differentiation and function, suggesting that OK represents a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of osteoclast-associated bone diseases.</AbstractText>

Common granular forage was fed to rats in the blank control group. High fat forage was fed to rats in the hyperlipidemia group and the hyperlipidemia treatment group. Rats in the PDS hyperlipidemia group and the PDS hyperlipidemia treatment group were treated with excessive labor and improper diet for modeling. They were administered refined lard by gastrogavage (3 mL each time, twice per day) and fed with high fat forage on the odd days, and fed with wild cabbage freely on even days. The modeling lasted for 30 days. Rats in the hyperlipidemia treatment group and PDS hyperlipidemia treatment group were administered with Huayu Qutan Recipe (20 mL/kg) by gastrogavage, once a day, for 30 successive days. Levels of serum cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and serum amylase (AMY) were detected by automatic biochemical analyzer. D-xylose excretion rate was determined using phloroglucinol method. Morphological changes of liver and the lipid deposition in liver were observed using HE stain and oil red O stain respectively, mRNA and protein expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), cholesterol 7&#x3B1;-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1), LDL-R, and sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) were detected using real time RT-PCR and Western blotting.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>For a multicomponent therapy, molecular network is essential to uncover its specific mode of action from a holistic perspective. The molecular system of a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula can be represented by a 2-class heterogeneous network (2-HN), which typically includes chemical similarities, chemical-target interactions and gene interactions. An important premise of uncovering the molecular mechanism is to identify mixed modules from complex chemical-gene heterogeneous network of a TCM formula. We thus proposed a novel method (MixMod) based on mixed modularity to detect accurate mixed modules from 2-HNs. At first, we compared MixMod with Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm (CNM), Markov Cluster algorithm (MCL), Infomap and Louvain on benchmark 2-HNs with known module structure. Results showed that MixMod was superior to other methods when 2-HNs had promiscuous module structure. Then these methods were tested on a real drug-target network, in which 88 disease clusters were regarded as real modules. MixMod could identify the most accurate mixed modules from the drug-target 2-HN (normalized mutual information 0.62 and classification accuracy 0.4524). In the end, MixMod was applied to the 2-HN of Buchang naoxintong capsule (BNC) and detected 49 mixed modules. By using enrichment analysis, we investigated five mixed modules that contained primary constituents of BNC intestinal absorption liquid. As a matter of fact, the findings of in vitro experiments using BNC intestinal absorption liquid were found to highly accord with previous analysis. Therefore, MixMod is an effective method to detect accurate mixed modules from chemical-gene heterogeneous networks and further uncover the molecular mechanism of multicomponent therapies, especially TCM formulae.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are a novel cell source used in stem cell therapy to treat bone diseases owing to their high potential to differentiate into osteoblasts. Effective induction of osteogenic differentiation from human BM-MSCs is critical to fulfill their therapeutic potential. In this study, Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE), a traditional herbal medicine, was used to stimulate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human BM-MSCs. The present study revealed that GBE improved the proliferation and osteogenesis of human BM-MSCs in a dose-dependent manner in the range 25-75 mg/l, as indicated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium content. However, such effect was decreased or inhibited at 100mg/l or higher. The dose-dependent improvement in osteogenesis of human BM-MSCs by GBE was further confirmed by the dose-dependent upregulation of marker genes, osteopontin (OPN) and Collagen I. The increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression and minimal expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#x3BA;B ligand (RANKL) suggested that GBE also inhibited osteoclastogenesis of human BM-MSCs. Further mechanistic study demonstrated that the transcriptional levels of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in the BMP signaling, &#x3B2;-catenin and Cyclin D1 in the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling, increased significantly during GBE-promoted osteogenesis. Meanwhile, loss-of-function assay with the signaling inhibitor(s) confirmed that the BMP and Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling pathways were indispensable during the GBE-promoted osteogenesis, suggesting that GBE improved osteogenesis via upregulation of the BMP and Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling. The present study proposed GBE to be used to upregulate the osteogenic differentiation of human BM-MSCs for new bone formation in BM-MSC-based cell therapy, which could provide an attractive and promising treatment for bone disorders.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The role of pulchinenoside (PULC) in the regulation of MeCP2 expression was investigated in RA model rats. Adjuvant arthritis rats were used as RA model rats, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from the RA model rats were cultured. The effect of 100 mg x kg(-1) PULC gavage treatment on the MeCP2 expression and the effect of MeCP2 siRNA on the expression of SFRP2 and &#x3B2;-catenin were detected by real time qPCR and Western blotting. The role of PULC in the FLS proliferation was detected by MTT. The results showed that the MeCP2 expression was down-regulated, the SFRP2 expression was up-regulated and the FLS proliferation was inhibited in FLS after therapy. MeCP2 siRNA significantly inhibited the MeCP2 expression, up-regulated the SFRP2 expression and inhibited the &#x3B2;-catenin expression in FLS from RA model rats. PULC may increase the SFRP2 expression, inhibit the Wnt signaling and inhibit the FLS proliferation in FLS from the RA model rats by inhibiting the MeCP2 expression.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein are vital in the understanding of the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a consequence, regulation of the expression of both APP and tau proteins is one important approach in combating AD. The APP and tau proteins can be targeted at the levels of transcription, translation and protein structural integrity. This paper reports the utilization of a bi-cistronic vector containing either APP or tau internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements flanked by &#x3B2;-galactosidase gene (cap-dependent) and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) (cap-independent) to discern the mechanism of action of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Results indicate that memantine could reduce the activity of both the APP and tau IRES at a concentration of ~10 &#x3BC;M (monitored by SEAP activity) without interfering with the cap-dependent translation as monitored by the &#x3B2;-galactosidase assay. Western blot analysis of the tau protein in neuroblastoma (N2A) and rat hippocampal cells confirmed the halting of the expression of the tau proteins. We also employed this approach to identify a preparation named NB34, extracts of Boussingaultia baselloides (madeira-vine) fermented with Lactobacillus spp., which can function similarly to memantine in both IRES of APP and Tau. The water maze test demonstrated that NB34 could improve the spatial memory of a high fat diet induced neurodegeneration in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. These results revealed that the bi-cistronic vector provided a simple, and effective platform in screening and establishing the mechanistic action of potential compounds for the treatment and management of AD.</AbstractText>

ACC-2 cell in human with ACC of lacrimal gland disposed by EGB of different concentration was in vitro cultured. MTT method was used for cell proliferation detection. Annexin V/PI double-staining flow cytometer was used to detect cell apoptosis and cell cycle. Survivin and TIP30 gene expression together with protein expression were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. And it is indicated that EGB has inhibitory effect on the proliferation of ACC-2 cell in vitro. Furthermore, the dose-effect relationship was significant. Compared with the control group, it had statistical difference (P &lt;0.01). The inhibitory concentration 50% (ICso) is 88 mg . L-1. By flow cytometer examination, it was indicated that EGB can gradually increase ACC-2 cell in G0-G1 stage and decrease it in G2-M and S stage. With the increase of dose, the apoptosis rate of ACC-2 cell obviously increased (P &lt;0.05 or P &lt;0.01). Both of the expression results of RT-PCR and Western hybrid proteins have showed that the concentration of EGB increased, it could be seen a significant decrease in Survivin gene expression (P &lt;0.01). Meanwhile, the TIP30 gene expression got a significant increase. Therefore, EGB can effectively inhibit ACC-2 cell Survivin gene expression in human with adenoid cysistic carcinoma of larcrimal gland as well as promoting TIP30 gene expression, inducing the ACC-2 cell apoptosis and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, which provided a certain theoretical and experimental basis for the application of Chinese herbal medicinal ingredient in the treatment of tumors.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>To study the protective mechanism of Danhong injection on brain microvascular endothelial cells (rBMECs) injured by hypoxic. In the experiment, primary suckling mouse's rBMECs cells were collected and identified with factor VIII to establish the 4 h injury model. Meanwhile, rBMECs were given Danhong injection (25, 50, 100 mL . L-1), and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level were detected by the biochemical method. Cell MMP-9, ICAM-1 and P53 mRNA expression levels were detected by RT-PCR method. Changes in cells' microscopic structure were observed by transmission electron microscope. According to the results, primary rBMECs were notably injured by hypoxia. Compared with model group, Danhong injection (50, 100 mL . L-1) could remarkably resist the injury induced by hypoxic, increase intracellular SOD activity, decrease MDA level and significantly down-regulate ICAM-1, MMP-9 and P53 mRNA expressions. Danhong injection (100 mL . L-1) could protect the cells' normal morphology and microscopic structure, maintain the close intercellular junction, and inhibit the hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis. The results showed that Danhong injection plays a significant role in protecting rBMECs injured by hypoxia. Its mechanism may be related to the enhancement of cells' antioxidant capacity, the inhibition of inflammatory response and the cell apoptosis.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is downregulated in the cortex of experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) animals. This study is to examine the effect of glycyrrhizin on the alternation of PPARs and proinflammatory cytokines in a rodent SAH model. CSF cytokines were evaluated by RT-PCR. Basilar arteries (BAs) were harvested to examine PPARs (RT-PCR and Western blot), and a morphological examination was conducted. Deformed endothelium and tortuous elastic lamina were observed in the BAs of the SAH groups, but they were absent in the glycyrrhizin groups or the healthy controls. The PPAR-&#x3B3; and -&#x3B4; protein levels were reduced in the SAH groups (p &lt; 0.01). Glycyrrhizin significantly increased the expressed PPAR-&#x3B3; protein and mRNA (preconditioning) and PPAR-&#x3B4; mRNA (both treatment and preconditioning), which corresponded to the reduced IL-1&#x3B2; and TNF-&#x3B1; levels. The administration of a PPAR-&#x3B3; inhibitor, BADGE, halted the reduction of IL-1&#x3B2; and TNF-&#x3B1; in the glycyrrhizin groups. Conclusively, glycyrrhizin exerts anti-inflammatory effects on SAH-induced vasospasm and attenuates the expression of PPARs, especially PPAR-&#x3B3;, which corresponds to the severity of SAH-related inflammation. These findings also offer credit to the antivasospastic effect of glycyrrhizin and its vasculoprotective effect in animals subjected to SAH.</AbstractText>

Therefore, we describe the population pharmacokinetic profile of the Qishe pill and compare its metabolic rate in the three major constitution types (Qi-Deficiency, Yin-Deficiency and Blood-Stasis) to address major challenges to individualized standardized TCM.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHODS/DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Healthy subjects (N = 108) selected based on constitutional types will be assessed, and standardized pharmacokinetic protocol will be used for assessing demographic, physiological, and pathological data. Laboratory biomarkers will be evaluated and blood samples collected for pharmacokinetics(PK) analysis and second-generation gene sequencing. In single-dose administrations, subjects in each constitutional type cohort (N = 36) will be randomly divided into three groups to receive different Qishe pill doses (3.75, 7.5 and 15 grams). Multiomics, including next generation sequencing, metabolomics, and proteomics, will complement the Qishe pill's multilevel assessment, with cytochrome P450 genes as targets. In a comparison with the general population, a systematic population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model for the Qishe pill will be established and verified.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Increased energy intake and reduced physical activity can lead to obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Transcriptional modulation of metabolic networks has become a focus of current drug discovery research into the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders associated with energy surplus and obesity. Tang-Nai-Kang (TNK), a mixture of five herbal plant extracts, has been shown to improve abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with pre-diabetes. Here, we report the metabolic phenotype of SHR.Cg-Leprcp/NDmcr (SHR/cp) rats treated with TNK. Pre-diabetic SHR/cp rats were randomly divided into control, TNK low-dose (1.67 g/kg) and TNK high-dose (3.24 g/kg) groups. After high-dose treatment for 2 weeks, the serum triglycerides and free fatty acids in SHR/cp rats were markedly reduced compared to controls. After 3 weeks of administration, the high dose of TNK significantly reduced the body weight and fat mass of SHR/cp rats without affecting food consumption. Serum fasting glucose and insulin levels in the TNK-treated groups decreased after 6 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, TNK-treated rats exhibited obvious improvements in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The improved glucose metabolism may be caused by the substantial reduction in serum lipids and body weight observed in SHR/cp rats starting at 3 weeks of TNK treatment. The mRNA expression of NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and genes related to fatty acid oxidation was markedly up-regulated in the muscle, liver and adipose tissue after TNK treatment. Furthermore, TNK promoted the deacetylation of two well-established SIRT1 targets, PPAR&#x3B3; coactivator 1&#x3B1; (PGC1&#x3B1;) and forkhead transcription factor 1 (FOXO1), and induced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in different tissues. These observations suggested that TNK may be an alternative treatment for pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome by inducing a gene expression switch toward fat oxidation through the activation of SIRT1 and AMPK signaling.</AbstractText>

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used as a complementary therapy for cancer for decades in China. CHM was proved to be effective in improving the quality of life (QOL) and reducing the toxicity associated with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. The purpose of the present trial is to determine whether CHM (Fuzheng Kang'ai decoction (FZKA), a CHM formula) combined with gefitinib results in longer progression-free survival with less toxicity than gefitinib alone.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The nuclear factor &#x3BA;B (NF-&#x3BA;B) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contribute to multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumor chemotherapy. The essential phenomenon of oncogenic activation of NF-&#x3BA;B in cancer-initiating cells showing MDR resulting from increased IL-6 expression is still unclear. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been the objective of intensive study. The aim of this study was to investigate the selective and potential efficacy of BRM270 against stem-like cancer-initiating cells (SLCICs) via the molecular mechanisms of its anticancer effects. Co-regulation of NF-&#x3BA;B and Cdk6 might be new arena to mitigate tumorigenesis. In the present study phyto-drug based approach provides a new avenue in understanding the amelioration and regulatory mechanisms in CSCs. In the present study, an in vivo tumor metastasis model of osteosarcoma was established by injecting Cal72 and SaOS-2 SLCICs into the right lower flank of nude mice. Later the development of tumor was analyzed by LICOR Biosciences (Pearl image analyzer). Significant suppression of activation of NF-&#x3BA;B and LPS-induced gene expression and apoptosis by BRM270 was confirmed by FACS, western blotting and qPCR. Further, both p65 and Cdk6 were significantly (P&lt;0.05) overexpressed in BRM270 non-treated Cal72 SLCICs compared to treated group. BRM270 directly dephosphorylated RelA and selectively inhibited NF-&#x3BA;B transcriptional activity, resulting in decreased expression of interleukin-6, a cytokine implicated in cancer metastasis. BRM270-mediated cell shrinkage, pyknosis, karyorrhexis and programmed cell death (PCD) were observed by Hoechst 33342 staining while flow cytometry analysis showed significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease in cell population from G0-G1 phases. These findings suggest that activation of the oncogenic Cdk6-NF-&#x3BA;B pathway, resulting from increased IL-6 expression, plays a central role in CD133 expressing SLCICs augmented MDR and neoplasia. This study proposes targeting of NF-&#x3BA;B, and Cdk6 with IL-6 as potential targets for PCD and treatment of chemotherapeutic resistance of CSCs to design novel therapies for their elimination.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>1.&#x2002;Induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes can affect drug efficacy and cause toxicity. However, so far, limited information is available regarding the molecular mechanism how herbal medicines induce human CYP2B6, which metabolizes many of the clinically used therapeutics and activates several pro-carcinogens or toxicants. Accumulated evidence suggests that the human constitutive androstane receptor (hCAR) and the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) play important roles in trans-activation of CYP2B6. In this study, we investigated the effects of 68 Chinese herbal ingredients on the receptor specificity of hPXR/hCAR-mediated CYP2B6 induction by luciferase reporter gene assays in transiently transfected HepG2 cells and on the expression of CYP2B6 in LS174T cells. 2.&#x2002;The HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with human CYP2B6 luciferase promoter reporter plasmids along with hPXR or hCAR3. The results indicated that apigenin (Api), curcumol (Cur) and praeruptorin A (Pra A) were identified as potent activators of hPXR, and Pra A was also a ligand of hCAR. 3.&#x2002;Furthermore, CYP2B6 mRNA expression in LS174T cells treated with the three herbal ingredients was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. By combining western blot and LC-MS/MS, CYP2B6 protein expression and catalytic activity induced by the three herbal ingredients were measured. 4.&#x2002;Our observation showed Api and Cur up-regulated CYP2B6 expression by transactivation of hPXR, and Pra A acted as the ligand of both hPXR and hCAR to induce CYP2B6 expression.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Stressful events are known to down-regulate expression levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the brain. Recently, we reported that stressed mice with elevated plasma levels of corticosterone exhibit morphological changes in the oligodendrocytes of nerve fiber bundles, such as those in the corpus callosum. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of GR expression regulation in oligodendrocytes after stress exposure. A previous report has suggested that GR protein levels might be regulated by microRNA (miR)-18 and/or -124a in the brain. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the GR regulation mechanism in oligodendrocytes and evaluate the effects of yokukansan (YKS), a Kampo medicine, on GR protein regulation. Acute exposure to stress increased plasma corticosterone levels, decreased GR protein expression, and increased miR-124a expression in the corpus callosum of adult male mice, though the GR mRNA and miR-18 expression levels were not significant changes. YKS normalized the stress-induced changes in the plasma corticosterone, GR protein, and miR124a expression levels. An oligodendrocyte primary culture study also showed that YKS down-regulated miR-124a, but not miR-18, expression levels in dexamethasone-treated cells. These results suggest that the down-regulation of miR124a expression might be involved in the normalization of stress-induced decreases in GR protein in oligodendrocytes by YKS. This effect may imply the molecular mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effects of YKS on psychological symptoms and stress-related behaviors.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Water-dispersible MgO nanoparticles were tested to investigate their cytotoxic effects on oxidative stress gene expression. In this in vitro study, genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase, were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reactions (molecular level) and molecular beacon technologies (cellular level). The monodispersed MgO nanoparticles, 20 nm in size, were used to treat human cancer cell lines (liver cancer epithelial cells) at different concentrations (25, 75 and 150 &#xB5;g/mL) and incubation times (24, 48 and 72 h). Both the genetic and cellular cytotoxic screening methods produced consistent results, showing that GST and catalase ROS gene expression was maximized at 150 &#xB5;g/mL nanoparticle treatment with 48 h incubation. However, the genotoxic effect of MgO nanoparticles was not significant compared with control experiments, which indicates its significant potential applications in nanomedicine as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>To study the protective effect of combined administration of active ingredients of Danhong on cultured primary mice's brain microvascular endothelial cells (rBMECs) injured by hypoxia. Primary mice's brain micro-vascular endothelial cells were cultured to establish the 4 h hypoxia model. Meanwhile, active ingredients (protocatechuic aldehyde, salvianolic acid B, hydroxysafflor yellow A and tanshinol) of Danhong were administered in rBMECs. The non-toxic dosage was determined by MTT. The leakage of lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), cell superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and MDA level were detected by the colorimetric method. The expressions of ICAM-1, MMP-9, P53 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR method. Changes in rBMECs cell cycle and early apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Danhong's active ingredients and prescriptions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 could be combined to significantly restrain LDH in hypoxic cells supernatant. Prescriptions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 could significantly enhance SOD activity in anoxic cells; Prescriptions 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 could significantly decrease the MDA level; Prescriptions 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 could significantly inhibit the early rB-MECs apoptosis induced by hypoxia. After hypoxia, the up-regulated P53 mRNA expression could cause retardation in G, phase and promote cell apoptosis. This proved that the regulatory function of P53 gene lay in monitoring of calibration points in G, phase. Prescriptions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 could significantly down-regulate the P53 mRNA expression; Prescriptions 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 could significantly down-regulate the ICAM-1 mRNA expression; Prescriptions 1, 3, 6, 9 could significantly down-regulate the MMP-9 mRNA expression. The combined administration of Danhong's active ingredients showed a significant protective effect on primary cultured rBMECs injury induced by hypoxia Its mechanism may be related to the enhancement of cellular antioxidant capacity and the inhibition of inflammatory response and cell apoptosis. This study could provide ideas for researching prescription compatibility, and guide the clinical medication.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic ailment with a rapidly increasing incidence due to dietary hypernutrition and subsequent obesity. Fatty liver disease can lead to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even cancer, which is associated with various complications. Discovering effective natural materials and herbs can provide alternative and complementary medical treatments to current chemical pharmaceuticals. To develop an effective natural agent for NAFLD, we formulated a combination of four herb mixtures (KIOM2012H) and observed lipid-lowering efficacy. The inhibitory effects of KIOM2012H on free fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation, triglyceride contents, and gene expressions were analyzed in HepG2 cells. Using high fat diet-fed mice, body weight changes, gross liver appearances, hepatic triglyceride contents, and gene expressions were evaluated. KIOM2012H dose-dependently inhibited lipid accumulation and gene expressions involved in lipogenesis and related regulators. Experimental animals also showed a decrease in body weight changes and lipid-associated physiological parameters. This study shows that KIOM2012H has an alleviating effect on fatty acid and lipid accumulation, and therefore can be applied for development of new therapeutic pharmaceuticals for treatment of NAFLD using natural products and herbs.</AbstractText>

The SAP model was induced by retrograde infusion of 1.5% sodium deoxycholate into the biliopancreatic duct of the rats. All rats were sacrificed 24 h post-SAP induction. Arterial blood, intestine, and pancreas from each rat were harvested for investigations. The levels of serum amylase (AMY) and diamine oxidase (DAO) were determined using biochemical methods, and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3B1; level was measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Pathologic changes in the harvested tissues were investigated by microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections. The expressions of sPLA2 at mRNA and protein levels were detected by reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blot, respectively. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay was used to investigate apoptosis of epithelial cells in the intestinal tissues.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Compared to the control group, the expression of sPLA2 at both the mRNA and protein levels increased significantly in the SAP group (0.36 &#xB1; 0.13 vs 0.90 &#xB1; 0.38, and 0.16 &#xB1; 0.05 vs 0.64 &#xB1; 0.05, respectively; Ps &lt; 0.01).

The apoptosis index of intestinal epithelial cells also differed significantly between the SAP and control rats (0.05 &#xB1; 0.02 vs 0.26 &#xB1; 0.06; P &lt; 0.01). The serum levels of DAO and TNF-&#x3B1;, and the intestinal apoptosis index significantly correlated with sPLA2 expression in the intestine (r = 0.895, 0.893 and 0.926, respectively; Ps &lt; 0.05). The levels of sPLA2, AMY, TNF-&#x3B1;, and DAO in the QYT, VER, and DEX groups were all decreased compared with the SAP group, but not the control group. Qingyi decoction intervention, however, gave the most therapeutic effect against intestinal barrier damage, although the onset of its therapeutic effect was slower.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Bone remodeling, a physiological process in which new bone is formed by osteoblasts and the preexisting bone matrix is resorbed by osteoclasts, is vital for the maintenance of healthy bone tissue in adult humans. Imbalances in this process can cause various pathological conditions, including osteoporosis. Emodin, a naturally occurring anthraquinone derivative found in Asian herbal medicines, has numerous beneficial pharmacologic effects, including anticancer and antidiabetic activities. However, the effect of emodin on the regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast activity has not yet been investigated. We show here that emodin is a potential target for osteoporosis therapeutics, as treatment with this agent enhances osteoblast differentiation and bone growth and suppresses osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. In this study, emodin suppressed receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#x3BA;B (NF-&#x3BA;B) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and the bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts by inhibiting RANKL-induced NF-&#x3BA;B, c-Fos, and NFATc1 expression. Emodin also increased ALP, Alizarin Red-mineralization activity, and the expression of osteoblastogenic gene markers, such as Runx2, osteocalcin (OCN), and ALP in mouse calvarial primary osteoblasts, as well as activated the p38-Runx2 pathway, which enhanced osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, mice treated with emodin showed marked attenuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone erosion and increased bone-forming activity in a mouse calvarial bone formation model based on micro-computed tomography and histologic analysis of femurs. Our findings reveal a novel function for emodin in bone remodeling, and highlight its potential for use as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of osteoporosis that promotes bone anabolic activity and inhibits osteoclast differentiation.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Ophiopogonin-D is one of steroidal saponins isolated from the root of the Chinese medicinal plant Ophiopogon japonicas. It has been claimed to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. The present study was the first to examine the anti-tumor metastasis properties of ophiopogonin-D. An MTT assay showed that ophiopogonin-D inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells, and decreased invasion was demonstrated using a Transwell invasion assay. Furthermore, adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and to fibronectin was inhibited by ophiopogonin-D. Gelatin zymography and western blot analysis showed that ophiopogonin-D inhibited the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), but not that of MMP-2. Inhibition of phosphorylation of p38 by ophiopogonin-D indicated its inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Overall, the results suggested that ophiopogonin-D may be considered as a candidate drug for treating or preventing tumor metastasis.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) is a well-established Traditional Chinese Medicinal formulation which has long been used to treat stroke in a clinical setting in China. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of GLGZD on inflammation in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was employed. Rats were administrated GLGZD (7.2 and 14.4 g/kg per day) or saline as control 2 h after reperfusion and daily over the following seven days. Neurological de&#xFB01;cit score and screen test were evaluated at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after MCAO. Brain infarct size and brain histological changes were observed via 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and regular hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining. Furthermore, inflammation mediators and nuclear factor-&#x3BA;B (NF-&#x3BA;B) were investigated using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. GLGZD treatment significantly improved neurological function, ameliorated histological changes to the brain and decreased infarct size in focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury. GLGZD was found to significantly reduce interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor-&#x3B1; and NF-&#x3BA;B levels, while increasing levels of IL-10. In conclusion, the present study suggested that GLGZD has a neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury and this effect is likely to be associated with the anti-inflammatory function of GLGZD.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The aim of the present study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: Sham (no MCAO), MCAO (MCAO with no GLGZD treatment) and GLGZD (MCAO with GLGZD treatment). Rats in the MCAO and GLGZD groups were subjected to permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Neurological function and infarct volume were measured. Microglial activation and inflammatory cell accumulation were measured using immunohistochemistry. mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators were examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of proteins associated with the nuclear factor &#x3BA;-B (NF-&#x3BA;B) inflammation signaling pathway was analyzed using western blotting. The results of the present study suggested that infarct size was significantly reduced and neurological behavior function was improved in rats with MCAO treated with GLGZD compared with rats in the MCAO group. Amoeboid microglial expansion and inflammatory cell migration were observed in the infarcted areas of rats in the GLGZD group and were not identified in those of the MCAO group. Target mRNA and protein levels, and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly reduced in the GLGZD group compared with the MCAO model group. Notably, GLGZD treatment induced neuroprotective effects, reducing inflammation and inhibiting NF-&#x3BA;B signaling compared with the MCAO group. Therefore, GLGZD may exhibit anti-in&#xFB02;ammatory effects against ischemia-reperfusion brain injury and may be a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Totally 50 SD male healthy rats were randomly divided into the normal control group (n = 10), the sham-operation group (n = 10), and the nephrectomy model group (n = 30) according to the proportion of 1:1:3. Rats in the sham-operation group had their renal capsule isolated without nephrectomy. Rats in the nephrectomy model group had their kidneys 5/6 nephrectomized. Then 24 h urine was collected and 24 h urinary protein (24 h UP) detected. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatitine (SCr) were also tested. According to the SCr level 30 rats of the model group were further randomly divided into the model group, the PBP group, and the Niaoduqing Granule (NG) group, 10 in each group. Rats in the PBP group and the NG group were respectively administered with PBP (at the daily dose of 1.0 g/kg) and NG (at the daily dose of 3.33 g/kg) by gastrogavage (they were dissolved in distilled water). At the same time, 2 mL distilled water was administered by gastrogavage to rats in the normal control group, the sham-operation group, and the nephrectomy model group, once daily for 4 successive weeks. Mental conditions, activities, hair color, shape of stool, and the body weight were observed during administration. After 4 weeks, urine was collected to detect 24 h UP. Blood was sampled to detect SCr, BUN, transforming growth factor &#x3B2;1 (TGF-&#x3B2;1), type III procollagen (PC III), collagen type IV (Col IV), laminin (LN), and fibronectin (FN). After rats were killed, their left remnant renal tissues were collected for pathological examinations. The protein expression quantity of TGF-&#x3B2;1 and FN was detected by immunohistochemical method. mRNA expression levels of TGF-&#x3B2;1 and FN were detected using real time fluorescent quantitative PCR.</AbstractText>

Compared with the sham-operation group, rats' general condition was poorer in the model group, their body weight grew slower, and 24 h UP increased; serum levels of BUN, SCr, TGF-&#x3B2;1, PC III, Col IV, LN, and FN increased; the residual renal pathological lesion was serious; expression levels of TGF-&#x3B2;1, TGF-&#x3B2;1, mRNA, FN, and FN mRNA increased in the renal tissue (all P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the model group, rats' general condition was better, their body weight grew faster, 24 h UP reduced (P &lt; 0.05), blood levels of BUN and SCr decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01), serum levels of TGF-&#x3B2;1, PC III, CoL IV, LN, and FN decreased (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01); the residual renal pathological lesion was attenuated in the PBP group and the NG group; expression levels of TGF-&#x3B2;1, TGF-&#x3B2;1, mRNA, FN, and FN mRNA decreased (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the NG group, blood levels of SCr and FN, and expression levels of FN and FN mRNA decreased more in the PBP group (P &lt; 0.05).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Animal models with kidney disease are generally divided into two types. One belongs to the models which imitate human kidney disease by the artificial operations, such as anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody nephritis, Heymann nephritis, anti-Thyl. 1 antibody nephritis, BSA nephritis and puromycin nephropathy. The other one pertains to the models which make themselves kidney disease, and appear the pathological characteristics naturally as like as human, such as HIGA mice with IgA nephropathy and NZB/WF1 and MRL/1pr mice with lupus nephritis. In addition,the transgenic animal models with kidney disease can also be established by the modern molecular biologic techniques including gene knockout and siRNA transfection. As for the studies related with kidney disease in pharmacodynamics and pharmacology of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), it is important to understand deeply the features of each animal model with kidney disease, and select accurately the proper models according to the different experimental objectives, and then, build the special models provided with the combination of disease with syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Therefore,it is the developmental direction for the further study to establish animal models with kidney disease, which should possess the characteristics of syndrome in TCM.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Nowadays herbal-derived medicines are attracting attention as new sources of drugs with few side effects. Silibinin is a flavonoid compound with chemotheraputic effects on different cancers such as examples in the prostate, lung, colon and breast. In the present study, the cytotoxic effects of silibinin on MCF7 breast cancer cells were investigated. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and the impact of silibinin on the expression of pivotal genes including Bak, P53, P21, BRCA1, BCL-X1 and ATM was analyzed. Treatment for 24h had a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth (p&lt;0.05) with dose- and time- dependent induction of apoptosis (p&lt;0.05). In addition, there were significant increases in BRCA1, ATM, Bak and Bcl-XL gene expression at the mRNA level with different concentrations of silibinin for 24 or 48 h (p&lt;0.05). Taken together, the results suggest that silibinin inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of MCF-7 cells by down-regulating Bak, P53, P21, BRCA1, BCL-Xl and thus may be considered as an effective adjuvant drug to produce a better chemopreventive response for the cancer therapy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>We collected the data on the Sendeng-4 chemical composition corresponding targets through the literature and from DrugBank, SuperTarget, TTD (Therapeutic Targets Database) and other databases and the relevant signaling pathways from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database and established models of the chemical composition-target network and chemical composition-target-disease network using Cytoscape software, the analysis indicated that the chemical composition had at least nine different types of targets that acted together to exert effects on the diseases, suggesting a "multi-component, multi-target" feature of the traditional Mongolian medicine. We also employed the rat model of rheumatoid arthritis induced by Collgen Type II to validate the key targets of the chemical components of Sendeng-4, and three of the key targets were validated through laboratory experiments, further confirming the anti-inflammatory effects of Sendeng-4. In all, this study predicted the active ingredients and targets of Sendeng-4, and explored its mechanism of action, which provided new strategies and methods for further research and development of Sendeng-4 and other traditional Mongolian medicines as well.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Chemoresistance is the most common cause of chemotherapy failure during breast cancer (BCA) treatment. It is generally known that the mechanisms of chemoresistance in tumors involve multiple genes and multiple signaling pathways,; if appropriate drugs are used to regulate the mechanisms at the gene level, it should be possible to effectively reverse chemoresistance in BCA cells. It has been confirmed that chemoresistance in BCA cells could be reversed by ginsenoside Rh2 (G-Rh2). Preliminary studies of our group identified some drug- resistance specific miRNA. Accordingly, we proposed that G-Rh2 could mediate drug-resistance specific miRNA and corresponding target genes through the gene regulatory network; this could cut off the drug-resistance process in tumors and enhance treatment effects. G-Rh2 and breast cancer cells were used in our study. Through pharmaceutical interventions, we could explore how G-Rh2 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance in BCA, and analyze its impact on related miRNA and target genes. Finally, we will reveal the anti-resistance molecular mechanisms of G-Rh2 from a different angle in miRNA-mediated chemoresistance signals among cells.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Delphinidin 3-sambubioside (Dp3-Sam), a Hibiscus anthocyanin, was isolated from the dried calices of Hibiscus sabdariffa L, which has been used for folk beverages and herbal medicine although the molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. Based on the properties of Dp3-Sam and the information of inflammatory processes, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activity and molecular mechanisms in both cell and animal models in the present study. In the cell model, Dp3-Sam and Delphinidin (Dp) reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators including iNOS, NO, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-&#x3B1; induced by LPS. Cellular signaling analysis revealed that Dp3-Sam and Dp downregulated NF-&#x3BA;B pathway and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling. In animal model, Dp3-Sam and Dp reduced the production of IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-&#x3B1; and attenuated mouse paw edema induced by LPS. Our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that Hibiscus Dp3-Sam possessed potential anti-inflammatory properties.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Mutant huntingtin aggregation is highly associated with the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease, an adult-onset autosomal dominant disorder, which leads to a loss of motor control and decline in cognitive function. Recent literature has revealed the protective role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases through degradation of mutant toxic proteins, including huntingtin or a-synuclein. Through the GFP-LC3 autophagy detection platform, we have &#xA0;identified &#xA0;neferine, &#xA0;isolated &#xA0;from &#xA0;the &#xA0;lotus &#xA0;seed &#xA0;embryo &#xA0;of Nelumbo nucifera, which is able to induce autophagy through an AMPK-mTOR-dependent pathway. Furthermore, by overexpressing huntingtin with 74 CAG repeats (EGFP-HTT 74) in PC-12 cells, neferine reduces both the protein level and toxicity of mutant huntingtin through an autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7)-dependent mechanism. With the variety of novel active compounds present in medicinal herbs, our current study suggests the possible protective mechanism of an autophagy inducer isolated from Chinese herbal medicine, which is crucial for its further development into a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders in the future.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>This study was designed to explore the effects and mechanism of ergostatrien-3&#x3B2;-ol (EK100) from the submerged whole broth of Antrodia camphorata on diabetes and dyslipidemia in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice for 12 weeks. The C57BL/6J mouse fed with a high fat diet (HFD) could induce insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. After 8 week of induction, mice were receiving EK100 (at three dosages) or fenofibrate (Feno) or rosiglitazone (Rosi) or vehicle by oral gavage 4 weeks afterward. HFD-fed mice display increased blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), insulin, and leptin levels. These blood markers were significantly lower in EK100-treated mice, and finally ameliorated insulin resistance. EK100 treatment exhibited reduced hepatic ballooning degeneration and size of visceral adipocytes. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) proteins and phosphorylation of Akt in skeletal muscle were significantly increased in EK100- and Rosi-treated mice. EK100, Feno, and Rosi treatment led to significant increases in phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (phospho-AMPK) protein in both skeletal muscle and liver. Moreover, EK100 caused a decrease in hepatic expressions of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6 Pase), and decreased glucose production. EK100 lowered blood TG level by inhibition of hepatic fatty acid synthesis by dampening sterol response element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) but increasing expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x3B1; (PPAR&#x3B1;). Moreover, EK100-treated mice reduced blood TC levels by decreased hepatic expressions of SREBP2, which plays a major role in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis. EK100 increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations by increasing expressions of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) in liver tissue. Our findings manifest that EK100 may have therapeutic potential in treating type 2 diabetes associated with hyperlipidemia in HFD-fed mice by regulation of GLUT4, PEPCK, G6 Pase, SREBP1c, SREBP2, apo A-I, and AMPK phosphorylation.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease mainly characterized by B cell hyperactivity. Glucocorticoid (GC) is widely used in SLE for its potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Despite its important clinical efficacy, high-dose or long-term use of GC can cause severe side effects, such as osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, cataracts, hyperglycemia, coronary heart disease and cognitive impairment. Our early clinical studies have shown that Jieduquyuzishen prescription (JP) can effectively reduce the adverse effects and improve the curative effect of GC in the treatment of SLE. The BAFF/BAFF-R signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of SLE and has been regarded as a potential target for the therapy of SLE. In this study, we attempt to investigate the effect of JP on the BAFF/BAFF-R signaling pathway to explore the mechanism of JP in reducing the toxicity and enhancing the efficacy of GC. YAC-1 cells, isolated rat peripheral blood lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils and spleen lymphocytes were treated with drug-containing serum. The results of RT-PCR, Western blot and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays indicate that either JP or GC can inhibit the mBAFF-induced up-regulation of BAFF, BAFF-R, Bcl-2, IL-10 and NF-&#x3BA;B in YAC-1 cells and WEHI-231 cells. Furthermore, MTS, flow cytometry and CFSE results reveal that the proliferation and survival of lymphocytes activated by mBAFF are suppressed by JP, GC and their combination. Contrary to GC, JP can reduce the apoptosis and raise the survival of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and can't increase the apoptosis of the peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen lymphocytes. Therefore, it is possible that JP can down-regulate the BAFF/BAFF-R signaling pathway as effectively as GC, which may result in the dosage reduction of GC, thus decreasing the toxicity and improving the efficacy of GC-based treatment of SLE.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to observe the alleviation of the ethanol extract of Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl. (DC), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on DR and its engaged mechanism. After DC (30 or 300&#x2009;mg/kg) was orally administrated, the breakdown of blood retinal barrier (BRB) in streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats was attenuated by DC. Decreased retinal mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (including occludin and claudin-1) in diabetic rats was also reversed by DC. Western blot analysis and retinal immunofluorescence staining results further confirmed that DC reversed the decreased expression of occludin and claudin-1 proteins in diabetic rats. DC reduced the increased retinal mRNA expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor &#x3B1; (TNF&#x3B1;), interleukin- (IL-) 6, and IL-1&#x3B2; in diabetic rats. In addition, DC alleviated the increased 1 and phosphorylated p65, I&#x3BA;B, and I&#x3BA;B kinase (IKK) in diabetic rats. DC also reduced the increased serum levels of TNF&#x3B1;, interferon-&#x3B3; (IFN-&#x3B3;), IL-6, IL-1&#x3B2;, IL-8, IL-12, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-10 in diabetic rats. Therefore, DC can alleviate DR by inhibiting retinal inflammation and preventing the decrease of tight junction proteins, such as occludin and claudin-1.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Male rats (n = 45) of clean grade (200 &#xB1; 20 g) were divided into five groups after one week of adaptive feeding: primary control, depression model, low dose XYS, middle dose XYS, and high dose XYS. The animal experiment continued for 3 wk. Primary controls were fed normally ad libitum. The rats of all other groups were raised in solitary and exposed to classic chronic mild unpredictable stimulation each day. XYS groups were perfused intragastrically with low dose, middle dose, and high dose XYS one hour before stimulation. Primary control and depression model groups were perfused intragastrically with normal saline under similar conditions as the XYS groups. Three weeks later, all rats were sacrificed, and the expression levels of CNP and NPR-B in rectum tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">CNP and NPR-B were both expressed in the rectum tissues of all rats. However, the expression levels of CNP and NPR-B at both gene and protein levels in the depression model group were significantly higher when compared to the primary control group (n = 9; P &lt; 0.01). XYS intervention markedly inhibited the expression levels of CNP and NPR-B in depressed rats. The expression levels of CNP and NPR-B in the high dose XYS group did not significantly differ from the expression levels in the primary control group. Additionally, the high and middle dose XYS groups (but not the low dose group) significantly exhibited lower CNP and NPR-B expression levels in the rectum tissues of the respectively treated rats compared to the untreated depression model cohort (n = 9; P &lt; 0.01).</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in almost all types of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process during the metastatic cascade. This process may be a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. Pien Tze Huang (PZH), a well-known traditional Chinese formula, has been demonstrated to be clinically effective in treating various types of human malignancies, including CRC. Our published data suggest that PZH can induce apoptosis, as well as inhibit cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, thus suppressing CRC growth in&#xA0;vitro and in&#xA0;vivo. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of PZH against CRC metastasis using a CRC liver metastasis mouse model to further explore the mechanisms underlying the antitumor action of PZH. MTT, migration, and Matrigel invasion assays were used to assess the effect of PZH on cell viability, migration and invasion. We then established an orthotopic liver metastasis model&#xA0;of colon cancer using microsurgical techniques. Mice were intragastrically administered 234&#xA0;mg/kg/day dose of either PZH or saline for 14&#xA0;days. The body and tumor weights of the mice were measured after they were sacrificed. Moreover, we examined the effect of PZH inhibition on liver metastasis. Finally, EMT-related proteins and the TGF-&#x3B2; signaling pathway were assessed using immunohistochemical staining (IHS). The present data revealed that PZH significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of CT-26 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which affirmed the inhibitory effect of PZH on CRC cell metastasis. No significant change was observed between the in&#xA0;vivo primary tumor growth and body weight. However, the control group had five cases of liver metastasis&#xA0;(5/6), whereas one case was found in the PZH group&#xA0;(1/6). Thus, PZH exhibited therapeutic efficacy against CRC metastasis without apparent toxicity. The inhibitory effect of PZH on EMT resulted in an increase in E-cadherin expression, as well as a decrease in N-cadherin expression. In addition, PZH significantly inhibited TGF-&#x3B2;, as well as the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and Smad4 in the tumor tissues, indicating its suppressive action on TGF-&#x3B2; signaling. These molecular effects ultimately resulted in the inhibition of cancer cell EMT and tumor metastasis.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Tanshinone IIA (TIIA) is a diterpene quinone extracted from the plant Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine. It has been reported to have anti-tumor potential against several kinds of cancer, including gastric cancer. In most solid tumors, a metabolic switch to glucose is a hallmark of cancer cells, which do this to provide nutrients for cell proliferation. However, the mechanism associated with glucose metabolism by which TIIA acts on gastric cancer cells remains to be elucidated.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">We found that TIIA treatment is able to significantly inhibit cell growth and the proliferation of gastric cancer in a dose-dependent manner. Using next-generation sequencing-based RNA-seq transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics-isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), we characterized the mechanism of TIIA regulation in gastric cancer cell line AGS. In total, 16,603 unique transcripts and 102 proteins were identified. After enrichment analysis, we found that TIIA regulated genes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, the cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage and cytoskeleton reorganization. Our proteomics data revealed the downregulation of intracellular ATP levels, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and L-lactate dehydrogenase B chains by TIIA, which might work with disorders of glucose metabolism and extracellular lactate levels to suppress cell proliferation. The up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of AKT was shown in TIIA- treated cells, which indicates the transformation of oncogenes. Severe DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition and apoptosis with cytoskeleton reorganization were detected in TIIA-treated gastric cancer cells.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Combining transcriptomics and proteomics results, we propose that TIIA treatment could lead cell stresses, including nutrient deficiency and DNA damage, by inhibiting the glucose metabolism of cancer cells. This study provides an insight into how the TIIA regulatory metabolism in gastric cancer cells suppresses cell growth, and may help improve the development of cancer therapy.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively activated in human cancers. Therefore, STAT3 is a therapeutic target of cancer drug discovery. We previously reported that natural products inhibited constitutively activated STAT3 in human prostate tumor cells. We used a dual-luciferase assay to screen 200 natural products isolated from herbal medicines and we identified ginkgetin obtained from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba L. as a STAT3 inhibitor. Ginkgetin inhibited both inducible and constitutively activated STAT3 and blocked the nuclear translocation of p-STAT3 in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, ginkgetin selectively inhibited the growth of prostate tumor cells stimulated with activated STAT3. Ginkgetin induced STAT3 dephosphorylation at Try705 and inhibited its localization to the nucleus, leading to the inhibition of expression of STAT3 target genes such as cell survival-related genes (cyclin D1 and survivin) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL). Therefore, ginkgetin inhibited the growth of STAT3-activated tumor cells. We also found that ginkgetin inhibited tumor growth in xenografted nude mice and downregulated p-STAT3(Tyr705) and survivin in tumor tissues. This is the first report that ginkgetin exerts antitumor activity by inhibiting STAT3. Therefore, ginkgetin is a good STAT3 inhibitor and may be a useful lead molecule for development of a therapeutic STAT3 inhibitor.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Epimedium koreanum Nakai has been extensively used in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine to treat a variety of diseases. Despite the plant's known immune modulatory potential and chemical make-up, scientific information on its antiviral properties and mode of action have not been completely investigated. In this study, the broad antiviral spectrum and mode of action of an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai was evaluated in vitro, and moreover, the protective effect against divergent influenza A subtypes was determined in BALB/c mice. An effective dose of Epimedium koreanum Nakai markedly reduced the replication of Influenza A Virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells. Mechanically, we found that an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the subsequent stimulation of the antiviral state in cells. Among various components present in the extract, quercetin was confirmed to have striking antiviral properties. The oral administration of Epimedium koreanum Nakai exhibited preventive effects on BALB/c mice against lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2). Therefore, an extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai and its components play roles as immunomodulators in the innate immune response, and may be potential candidates for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against diverse viruses in animal and humans.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Steatohepatitis plays a critical role in the process resulting in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Puerarin is a herbal product widely used in Asia, and is believed to have therapeutic benefits for alleviating the symptoms of steatohepatitis. The present study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of puerarin in reducing lipid accumulation in oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 cells. Hepatocytes were treated with OA with or without puerarin to observe lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining. We also examined hepatic lipid contents (e.g., triacylglycerol and cholesterol) following treatment with puerarin. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to measure sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x3B1; (PPAR&#x3B1;) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein and mRNA expression, respectively. Our results revealed that puerarin suppressed OA-induced lipid accumulation, and reduced the triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. Furthermore, puerarin decreased the expression levels of lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and SREBPs, and increased the expression levels of PPAR&#x3B1;, which are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism through the AMPK signaling pathway. These results indicate that puerarin has the same ability to activate AMPK, and reduce SREBP-1 and FAS expression, thus inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis and increasing hepatic antioxidant activity. We found that puerarin exerted a regulatory effect on lipid accumulation by decreasing lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Therefore, puerarin extract may have therapeutic benefits in the treatment of fatty liver and lipid-related metabolic disorders.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>The majority of the plant materials used in herbal medicine is procured from the markets in the form of dried or powdered plant parts. It is essential to use authentic plant materials to derive the benefits of herbal medicine. However, establishing the identity of these plant materials by conventional taxonomy is extremely difficult. Here we report a case study in which the species identification of the market samples of Sida cordifolia was done by DNA barcoding. As a prelude to species identification by DNA barcoding, 13 species of Sida were collected, and a reference DNA barcode library was developed using rbcL, matK, psbA-trnH and ITS2 markers. Based on the intra-species and inter-species divergence observed, psbA-trnH and ITS2 were found to be the best two-marker combination for species identification of the market samples. The study showed that none of the market samples belonged to the authentic species, S. cordifolia. Seventy-six per cent of the market samples belonged to other species of Sida. The predominant one was Sida acuta (36%) followed by S. spinosa (20%), S. alnifolia (12%), S. scabrida (4%) and S. ravii (4%). Such substitutions may not only fail to give the expected therapeutic effect, but may also give undesirable effects as in case of S. acuta which contains a 6-fold higher amount of ephedrine compared to the roots of S. cordifolia. The remaining 24% of the samples were from other genera such as Abutilon sp. (8%), Ixonanthes sp., Terminalia sp., Fagonia sp., and Tephrosia sp. (4% each). This observation is in contrast to the belief that medicinal plants are generally substituted or adulterated with closely related species. The current study strongly suggests that the raw drug market samples of herbal medicines need to be properly authenticated before use, and DNA barcoding has been found to be suitable for this purpose.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>In this study, we tested the potential role of astragaloside IV (AS-IV) against oxygen and glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced damages in murine cortical neurons, and studied the associated signaling mechanisms. AS-IV exerted significant neuroprotective effects against OGD/R by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, thereby attenuating oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. We found that AS-IV treatment in cortical neurons resulted in NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling activation, evidenced by Nrf2 Ser-40 phosphorylation, and its nuclear localization, as well as transcription of antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-regulated genes: heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) and sulphiredoxin 1 (SRXN-1). Knockdown of Nrf2 through lentiviral shRNAs prevented AS-IV-induced ARE genes transcription, and abolished its anti-oxidant and neuroprotective activities. Further, we discovered that AS-IV stimulated heparin-binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) release to trans-activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cortical neurons. Blockage or silencing EGFR prevented Nrf2 activation by AS-IV, thus inhibiting AS-IV-mediated anti-oxidant and neuroprotective activities against OGD/R. In summary, AS-IV protects cortical neurons against OGD/R damages through activating of EGFR-Nrf2 signaling.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the development of osteoporosis. Ophiopogonin D (OP-D), isolated from the traditional Chinese herbal agent Radix Ophiopogon japonicus, is a potent anti-oxidative agent. We hypothesized that OP-D demonstrates anti-osteoporosis effects via decreasing ROS generation in mouse pre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 cells and a macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells. We investigated OP-D on osteogenic and osteoclastic differentiation under oxidative status. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to establish an oxidative damage model. In vivo, we established a murine ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporosis model. Then, we searched the molecular mechanism of OP-D against osteoporosis. Our results revealed that OP-D significantly promoted the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells and improved some osteogenic markers. Moreover, OP-D reduced TRAP activity and the mRNA expressions of osteoclastic genes in RAW264.7 cells. OP-D suppressed ROS generation in both MC3T3-E1 and RAW264.7 cells. OP-D treatment reduced the activity of serum bone degradation markers, including CTX-1 and TRAP. Further research showed that OP-D displayed anti-osteoporosis effects via reducing ROS through the FoxO3a-&#x3B2;-catenin signaling pathway. In summary, our results indicated that the protective effects of OP-D against osteoporosis are linked to a reduction in oxidative stress via the FoxO3a-&#x3B2;-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting that OP-D may be a beneficial herbal agent in bone-related disorders, such as osteoporosis.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>On the model of focal ischemia-reperfusion of the brain investigated the induction of nitrosative stress in mitochondria of rats hearts and possible mechanisms of protective action of ecdysterone. It is shown that focal ischemia-reperfusion of the brain induced in myocardial mitochondria the activation of constitutive and inducible de novo synthesis of NO by oxidation of L-arginine and not oxidative synthesis of NO through the recovery of oxidized stable metabolites of NO. Strong evidence of induction of nitrosative stress in heart mitochondria by focal ischemia-reperfusion of the brain, was a significant increase in mitochondrial pool of nitrate- and nitrite-anions and pools of nitrosothiols, that is proof of the formation and decay of peroxynitrite--a key marker of nitrosative stress. Also was observed increase in heart mitochondria by focal ischemia-reperfusion of the brain, content key regulator of de novo synthesis of NO-hydrogen sulfide and activity of inducible arginase II and, as a result, the pool of carbamide, which is also a regulator of the synthesis of NO. Previous introduction for animals herbal extract Serratsula coronata, enriched ecdysterone, reduces induction nitrosative stress in mitochondria of rats hearts under conditions of focal ischemia-reperfusion of the brain.</AbstractText>

Rats in the activating blood circulation and detoxication group were administered with Xiongshao Capsule (at the daily dose of 0.39 g/kg) and Huanglian Capsule (at the daily dose of 0.135 g/kg). Rats in the metoprolol group received metoprolol at the daily dose of 2.25 mg/kg. And rats in the rest two groups were administered with normal saline. All medication lasted for 3 successive weeks. After the last administration, the rat model of acute myocardial infarction was prepared by ligation of left anterior descending artery. No ligation was given to rats in the sham-operation group. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after modeling. Tumor necrosis factor-&#x3B1; (TNF-&#x3B1;), &#x3B2;-thromboglobulin (&#x3B2;-TG), platelet &#x3B1; granule membrane protein-140 (GMP-140), 11 dehydro-thromboxane B2 (11-DH-TXB2), fibrinopeptide A (FPA), antithrombin III (AT-III), and D-dimer (DD) were detected by ELISA.

                <AbstractText>Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, has been a major target for cancer therapy. Antiangiogenic herbal medicines are useful in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we found that a water extract of Cinnamomum cassia (CCWE) was a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, CCWE suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation, and intracellular signaling events such as phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and VEGFR2, and activation of matrix metalloproteinase. Furthermore, CCWE inhibited VEGF-induced vessel sprouting of rat aorta ex vivo. These findings might be of particular interest for drug development because VEGF signaling is a potential target for treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a crucial pathogenic factor of osteoporosis. Gastrodin, isolated from the traditional Chinese herbal agent Gastrodia elata, is a potent antioxidant. We hypothesized that gastrodin demonstrates protective effects against osteoporosis by partially reducing reactive oxygen species in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) and a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7 cells). We investigated gastrodin on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation under oxidative stress in hBMMSCs. We also tested gastrodin on osteoclastic differentiation in RAW264.7 cells. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to establish an oxidative cell injury model. Our results showed that gastrodin significantly promoted the proliferation of hBMMSCs, improved some osteogenic markers, reduced lipid generation and inhibited the mRNA expression of several adipogenic genes in hBMMSCs. Moreover, gastrodin reduced the number of osteoclasts, TRAP activity and the expression of osteoclast-specific genes in RAW264.7 cells. Gastrodin suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species in both hBMMSCs and RAW264.7 cells. In vivo, we established a murine ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporosis model. Our data revealed that gastrodin treatment reduced the activity of serum bone degradation markers, such as CTX-1 and TRAP. Importantly, it ameliorated the micro-architecture of trabecular bones. Gastrodin decreased osteoclast numbers in vivo by TRAP staining. To conclude, these results indicated that gastrodin shows protective effects against osteoporosis linking to a reduction in reactive oxygen species, suggesting that gastrodin may be useful in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the major histological subtype of primary liver cancer, remains one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Due to the complicated pathogenesis of this malignancy, the outcome for comprehensive treatment is limited. Chinese&#xA0;herbal&#xA0;medicine&#xA0;(CHM) is emerging as a promising choice for its multi-targets and coordinated intervention effects against&#xA0;HCC. Ursolic acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic acid found in CHM, exerts anti-tumor effects and is emerging as an effective compound for cancer prevention and therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of UA remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that UA inhibited the growth of HCC cells and induced apoptosis in the dose- and time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, we found that UA induced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK&#x3B1;) and suppressed the protein expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the dose-dependent manner. The inhibitor of AMPK, compound C blocked, while an activator of AMPK, metformin augmented the effect of UA on DNMT1 expression. In addition, UA suppressed the expression of transcription factor Sp1. Conversely, overexpression of Sp1 reversed the effect of UA on DNMT1 expression and cell growth. Collectively, our results show for the first time that UA inhibits growth of HCC through AMPK&#x3B1;-mediated inhibition of Sp1; this in turn results in inhibition of DNMT1. This study reveals a potential novel mechanism by which UA controls growth of HCC cells and suggests that DNMT1 could be novel target for HCC&#xA0;chemoprevention and treatment.</AbstractText>

XZCBF has been clinically utilized in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine at General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command of PLA for many years and has exhibited favorable efficacy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of XZCBF on the expression of uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) and miR-34a in hyperuricemic mice and to determine, the correlation between the two expression levels.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A hyperuricemic animal model was created by administering adenine and allantoxanic acid potassium salt to mice. The blood uric acid levels were measured in these model mice after treatment with XZCBF for 15 days. The potential targets of miR-34a were screened. The expression levels of miR-34a and URAT1 in the renal tissues collected from the model mice were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, and their correlation was further established by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The uric acid levels in the model mice were significantly higher than those in the blank controls (P&lt;0.05). These levels were significantly lower in the three groups receiving different doses of XZCBF (P&lt;0.05), which was, in agreement with the downregulation of URAT1 and the upregulation of miR-34a in each group. The mRNA expression level of URAT1 was positively correlated with the concentration of uric acid but, negatively correlated with the expression level of miR-34a.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the primary antidote of APAP poisoning. Wuzhi tablet (WZ), the active constituents well identified and quantified, is a preparation of an ethanol extract of Schisandra sphenanthera and exerts a protective effect toward APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. However, the clinical use of WZ to rescue APAP-induced acute liver injury and the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effect of WZ remain unclear. Therefore, the effect of WZ on APAP hepatotoxicity was compared with NAC in mice, and molecular pathways contributing to its therapeutic action were investigated. Administration of WZ 4 hours after APAP treatment significantly attenuated APAP hepatotoxicity and exerted much better therapeutic effect than NAC, as revealed by morphologic, histologic, and biochemical assessments. Both WZ and NAC prevented APAP-induced c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase activation and mitochondrial glutathione depletion in livers. The protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 target genes including Gclc, Gclm, Ho-1, and Nqo1 was increased by WZ administration. Furthermore, p53 and p21 levels were upregulated upon APAP exposure, which were completely reversed by postdosing of WZ 4 hours after APAP treatment over 48 hours. In comparison with NAC, WZ significantly increased the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D-dependent kinase 4, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and augmenter of liver regeneration in APAP-injured livers. This study demonstrated that WZ possessed a therapeutic efficacy against APAP-induced liver injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and stimulating a regenerative response after liver injury. Thus WZ may represent a new therapy for APAP-induced acute liver injury.</AbstractText>

                <AbstractText>Sann&#x2011;Joong&#x2011;Kuey&#x2011;Jian&#x2011;Tang (SJKJT), a Traditional Chinese Medicinal prescription, has been used for the treatment of lymphadenopathy and solid tumors, and has shown therapeutic potential in a number of human malignant tumor cell lines, such as Hep&#x2011;G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Previous mechanistic studies demonstrated that SJKJT inhibited the proliferation of BxPC&#x2011;3 pancreatic carcinoma cells through the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in vitro. SJKJT was also shown to be cytotoxic to colo 205 colon cancer cells by inducing autophagy in vitro. The present study therefore investigated molecular mechanisms of autophagy in human BxPC&#x2011;3 pancreatic cancer cells treated with SJKJT. The cytotoxic effects of SJKJT on BxPC&#x2011;3 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were evaluated using an MTT assay. Furthermore, the expression of autophagy&#x2011;associated proteins, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), beclin&#x2011;1, autophagocytosis&#x2011;associated protein (Atg)3, Atg7, Atg5&#x2011;Atg12 and microtubule&#x2011;associated protein II light chain 3 (LC3&#x2011;II), was assessed using western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that BxPC&#x2011;3 cells treated with SJKJT exhibited decreased expression levels of mTOR and increased expression of LC3&#x2011;II protein. In addition, the expression of the beclin&#x2011;1, Atg3, Atg7 and Atg5&#x2011;Atg12 proteins was increased during the first 24 h, but decreased from 48 to 72 h. The results showed that SJKJT inhibited the proliferation of human BxPC&#x2011;3 pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. A possible underlying molecular mechanism may be the induction of autophagy. Further investigation into the therapeutic potential of SJKJT in human pancreatic cancer is required.</AbstractText>
